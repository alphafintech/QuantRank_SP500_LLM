A normalized composite trend-score algorithm has been developed  to rank S&P 500 constituents by the current strength and direction of their price trends. Trend Scoring Algorithm Overview：
OBJECTIVE  
Measure the short- to medium-term price momentum of every S&P 500 stock and output a 0-to-100 **Trend Score**.  The score blends ten technical signals that cover price structure, momentum, relative strength and volume confirmation, then ranks all tickers from strongest to weakest.

I. CORE METRICS AND HOW EACH IS CALCULATED  

Daily OHLCV data come from Yahoo Finance and are stored in SQLite; every metric below is refreshed each evening.

1. **Moving-average structure** – checks whether the 10-, 20-, 50- and 150-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are in strict bullish order (10 > 20 > 50 > 150).  
   • Score: 0 / 33 / 67 / 100 depending on how many of the three upward gaps are in place.

2. **50-day SMA slope** – linear-regression slope of the 50-day SMA over the last 20 trading days, divided by the current 50-day SMA to express it as a unit-free percentage.  
   • The result is mapped so a steep positive slope approaches 100 and a steep negative slope approaches 0.

3. **ADX (14-day)** – Average Directional Index taken straight from price highs, lows and closes.  
   • ADX of 15 or below scores 0; ADX 40 or above scores 100; linear in between.

4. **Rate-of-Change (ROC)** – 20-day percentage change in the closing price.  
   • 0 % is worth 50 points; +20 % maps to 100; –20 % maps to 0.

5. **RSI (14-day)** – Relative Strength Index.  
   • The closer RSI is to the neutral 50 line, the higher the score (peaks and troughs are penalised).

6. **MACD histogram slope** – regression slope of the MACD histogram over the last 20 days, normalised by the histogram’s own standard deviation.

7. **Relative strength versus the S&P 500** – excess return of the stock over SPY during the past 63 trading days.  
   • +20 % excess return scores 100; –20 % scores 0.

8. **OBV slope** – regression slope of On-Balance Volume over the last 20 days, again normalised by its standard deviation.

9. **Distance to 52-week high** – percentage the latest close sits below the one-year high.  
   • At the high (0 %) the score is 100; 20 % below the high scores 0.

10. **Volume surge ratio** – 20-day average volume divided by the 120-day average.  
    • The base-10 logarithm of the ratio is scaled so a clear pickup in turnover moves the score toward 100.

II. SCORING AND RANKING PROCESS  

1. **Data update**  
   • Prices and volumes are pulled or back-filled only for dates missing in the database (incremental update).  
   • Moving averages, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, volume averages, Stochastic %K/%D and OBV are recomputed for every ticker.  
   • Additional one-off series—ADX, 52-week high/low and 20-day ROC—are stored alongside daily data.

2. **Raw-to-score mapping**  
   • Each raw metric is transformed onto a 0-to-100 scale using the mapping rules listed under “Core Metrics”.  
   • Outliers are clipped so all scores stay between 0 and 100.

3. **Weighting**  
   Default weights (editable in *config_trend.ini*; they normalise to 100):  
   * Moving-average structure 15  
   * 50-day SMA slope 10  
   * ADX 15  
   * ROC 10  
   * RSI 5  
   * MACD-histogram slope 10  
   * Relative strength 10  
   * OBV slope 10  
   * Distance to 52-week high 10  
   * Volume surge ratio 5  

4. **Trend Score**  
   • Multiply each metric score by its weight, sum the results and divide by 100.

Concurrently, a normalized composite fundamental-growth score algorithm has been developed to rank S&P 500 constituents by their growth potential and quality.Fundamental Growth Scoring Algorithm Overview:
OBJECTIVE  
Evaluate every S&P 500 company on five dimensions—Growth, Quality, Efficiency, Safety, and Valuation—then combine them into a single Total Score (0-100) and a star rating.

I. CORE METRICS AND HOW EACH IS CALCULATED  

Growth metrics are measured two ways:  
• “FY” looks at the last two annual reports and averages the year-over-year percentage changes.  
• “Q-Seq” looks at the last four quarters and averages the quarter-over-quarter percentage changes.  
If a value changes from zero or negative to positive, its growth rate is set at plus one hundred percent.

A. GROWTH  
1. Revenue growth – percentage change in total revenue.  
2. EPS growth – percentage change in diluted EPS (if EPS is missing, use net income divided by shares outstanding).  
3. Free-cash-flow growth – percentage change in free cash flow, where free cash flow equals operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.  
4. Gross-margin change – change in gross profit as a proportion of revenue.  
(The FY and Q-Seq scores for each of these four items are later blended 40 % FY, 60 % Q-Seq.)

B. QUALITY  
5. ROIC – operating income after an assumed 21 % tax charge divided by invested capital.  
6. ROE – net income divided by shareholders’ equity.

C. EFFICIENCY  
7. Operating-cash-flow ratio – operating cash flow divided by revenue.  
8. Asset-turnover ratio – revenue divided by total assets.

D. SAFETY  
9. Net debt to EBITDA – total debt minus cash, then divided by EBITDA.  
10. Interest-coverage ratio – operating income divided by the absolute value of interest expense.  
11. Current ratio – current assets divided by current liabilities.

E. VALUATION  
12. PEG – share price divided by forward EPS, then divided by the EPS growth rate (calculated only when EPS growth is positive).  
13. Free-cash-flow yield – free cash flow divided by market capitalisation (share price times shares outstanding).

II. SCORING AND RANKING PROCESS  

1.  Download financial statements and prices, store them in SQLite, and compute the thirteen metrics above.

2.  Handle gaps and outliers  
    • Any missing figure is filled with the median figure for the same industry; if the industry has fewer than five companies, use the market-wide median instead.  
    • Extreme values beyond the 5th and 95th percentiles are pulled back to those limits.

3.  Convert raw numbers to 0-to-100 scores  
    • Rank each metric within its industry and express the ranking as a percentile.  
    • For “lower-is-better” items (Net debt / EBITDA and PEG) subtract the percentile from one hundred so that higher is always better.

4.  Blend growth items  
    • For each of the four growth items, blend its FY score and Q-Seq score using forty percent FY and sixty percent Q-Seq.

5.  Build each pillar score  
    • Growth score = 50 % revenue + 30 % EPS + 10 % free cash flow + 10 % gross margin (all using the blended values).  
    • Quality, Efficiency, Safety, Valuation scores are simple averages of their own sub-metrics.

6.  Total Score  
    Total Score = 45 % Growth + 20 % Quality + 10 % Efficiency + 15 % Safety + 10 % Valuation.

To better understand each stock's trend score and fundamental score, you can refer to the overview of how these two scores are calculated.

My current portfolio includes the following holdings, displayed as "Ticker: (Cost Basis, Share Count, Latest price)": (MA:$570.00, 184, $585.60), (HWM:$168.85, 621, $169.89), (NVDA:$135.20, 1162, $135.13), (PAYC:$255.00, 403, $259.09), (UBER:$78.00, 826, $84.16), (NFLX:$1,078.00, 89, $1,207.23), (GE:$234.00, 447, $245.91), (APH:$82.00, 1186, $89.93), (MSFT:$455.00, 346, $460.36), (Cash: $30,390).


Step 1 – Sentiment Analysis
For each stock listed above—including both the screened selections and the current portfolio holdings—conduct a comprehensive search and analysis of all news articles and social media discussions (e.g., on X, formerly Twitter) published between 2025-05-17 and 2025-05-31.
You can prioritize sentiment sources from official news outlets, X (formerly Twitter), earnings transcripts, and major financial news websites like Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, Wall street Journal and Seeking Alpha. You should focus on U.S.-based sentiment.
	•	Evaluate sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and coverage volume for every ticker, accounting for industry-specific factors such as sector trends, regulatory changes, and supply-chain dynamics.
	•	Integrate insights from the most recent earnings calls (up to 2025-05-31) to gauge management’s outlook on growth sustainability, revenue trajectories, and profitability, prioritizing stocks that exhibit consistent growth patterns and optimistic commentary suitable for a trend-based strategy.
	•	Assign each stock a sentiment score from 0 to 10 (10 = strongest positive sentiment and engagement; 0 = strongest negative).
	•	Provide a concise summary of sentiment trends for each stock, highlighting key events, recurring phrases, and the ways macroeconomic or industry factors shape perceptions.



Step 2 – Macroeconomic and Market Context

Analyze recent macroeconomic variables—including U.S. monetary policy (Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, forward guidance), inflation trends, GDP growth, tariffs, and other relevant economic policies—based on information published between 2025-05-17 and 2025-05-31. Prioritize official sources (e.g., Federal Reserve statements, Bureau of Economic Analysis reports, U.S. Treasury announcements) and major financial news websites (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ).

Examine contemporaneous trends in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices within the same time frame. Clearly synthesize these findings into a concise summary outlining the current macroeconomic environment, market sentiment, and outlook, specifically highlighting how recent U.S. monetary policy and macroeconomic shifts could impact equity market conditions in the near term.



Step 3 – Portfolio Adjustment and Rationale
Based on the latest fundamental, sentiment, and technical analyses of both my existing holdings and the screened stock selections—together with the current macroeconomic climate and market conditions as of 2025-05-31—recommend adjustments to optimize my portfolio.
Specifically:
* To help you make a more informed decision, I’ve listed the most recent market prices for each stock in my current portfolio. The format is: ‘Ticker: (Cost Basis, Share Count, Latest Price),’ where the last value indicates the latest available market price.
* Construct an optimized portfolio by selecting stocks exclusively from the combined set of my current holdings and the screened stocks.
* The optimized portfolio should hold no more than 7 stocks, including cash if justified.
* Ensure the total portfolio weights sum to exactly 100%.
* Given the anticipated holding period of 30 days, select positions expected to deliver favorable returns within this timeframe.
* When optimizing the portfolio, explicitly consider the current market prices, my original cost basis, and the predefined take-profit and stop-loss levels for each existing holding. Carefully evaluate whether the current market price is favorable before selling any stock. Similarly, thoroughly assess if the current market price presents a suitable buying opportunity when adding to existing positions or initiating new ones.


For each recommended stock or cash allocation, provide:
	1.	Rationale for selection. Clearly explain the reasoning behind choosing each stock or maintaining cash.
	2.	Determine the investment allocation and provide the rationale。
	3.	Define the exit strategy for the stock:
First, identify the stock’s latest price. Then, based on the current entry price, set a stop-loss level by specifying a percentage below the entry price and calculate the exact stop-loss price.
Also, set a take-profit level by specifying a percentage above the entry price and calculate the take-profit price.
The exit strategy should be informed by recent price levels, key technical support/resistance zones, or the stock’s volatility.
	4.	A concise justification summarizing strengths derived from:
	•	(a) Fundamental factors (e.g., earnings growth, valuation metrics).
	•	(b) Sentiment factors (e.g., investor perception, social-media buzz).
	•	(c) Technical factors (e.g., momentum, key support/resistance levels).
	5. Perform a technical analysis on this stock to determine whether the current price I’ve provided is a good buying opportunity. If it isn’t, suggest a price range that you believe would be more suitable for entry.


step 4 - Present your recommended stock and cash positions separately using both table and text formats:
- Table Format:
Clearly indicate the allocation percentage for each recommended stock. Additionally, include explicitly defined stop-loss and take-profit strategies, both expressed as percentages relative to the entry price. These strategies should be informed by recent price volatility, as well as key technical support and resistance levels.


- Text Format:
Provide a concise and clear presentation of each recommendation in a single line, using the following structure:
Ticker:Weight(e.g., AAPL:15%)
This format specifies the position size as a percentage of total capital, along with the number of shares currently held or to be transacted.


Requirements:

You must fully complete all the specified analysis steps. Ensure that your investment recommendations align accurately with market dynamics and conditions as of `2025-05-31`, aiming to enhance overall portfolio performance.


Finally, prepare your complete and structured analysis report in Chinese, ensuring it is logically organized, clearly articulated, and readily actionable for investment decision-making purposes.
