A normalized composite trend-score algorithm has been developed  to rank S&P 500 constituents by the current strength and direction of their price trends. Trend Scoring Algorithm Overview：
Objective: To calculate a composite trend score for S&P 500 stocks, quantifying the strength and direction of the prevailing trend based on technical indicators, and normalize the score for ranking.I. Core Indicator Dimensions & Scoring Concepts:The algorithm generates a raw score based on the latest status of the following five technical indicators:Moving Averages (MA Score):Concept: Evaluates the relationship between the stock's price, its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50), and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA200). Points are awarded based on classic trend confirmations (e.g., Price > SMA50 and SMA50 > SMA200 indicating a strong uptrend) or potential reversals.Purpose: To identify the primary trend direction (medium vs. long-term) and the price's position relative to it.MACD (MACD Score):Concept: Assesses the position of the MACD line relative to both the Signal line and the zero line (using standard 12, 26, 9 parameters). Points reflect bullish/bearish momentum strength and potential crossovers.Purpose: To gauge trend momentum and identify potential shifts.ADX (ADX Score):Concept: Scores based on the ADX(14) value and the relationship between the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI or DMP_14) and the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI or DMN_14). A score is assigned only if ADX > 25 (indicating a trending market), with the sign determined by whether +DI or -DI is dominant.Purpose: To measure the strength of the trend (filtering out non-trending markets) and confirm its direction.RSI (RSI Score):Concept: Assigns points based on whether the RSI(14) value is above a bullish threshold (e.g., 55) or below a bearish threshold (e.g., 45). Neutral readings receive zero points.Purpose: To provide secondary confirmation of bullish or bearish momentum.OBV (OBV Score):Concept: Compares the latest On-Balance Volume (OBV) value to its own Simple Moving Average (period defined in config, e.g., 20-day). Points are assigned based on whether OBV is trending above or below its average.Purpose: To incorporate volume flow for trend confirmation; rising OBV relative to its average supports an uptrend.II. Final Score Calculation:Weighted Raw Score: The individual raw scores from the five indicators above are summed using weights specified in the config_trend.ini file (w_ma, w_macd, w_adx, w_rsi, w_obv).Normalization (Normalized_Trend_Score): The resulting Weighted_Raw_Score for all stocks is then normalized using Min-Max Scaling to produce a final score between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate a stronger composite uptrend according to the model's inputs and weighting.Note: This score provides a quantitative snapshot based on historical price and volume data. Indicators have inherent lag. The score should be considered alongside other analytical methods and does not constitute investment advice.

Concurrently, a normalized composite fundamental-growth score algorithm has been developed to rank S&P 500 constituents by their growth potential and quality.Fundamental Growth Scoring Algorithm Overview:
Objective: To assess the growth potential and quality of S&P 500 companies by calculating a composite fundamental score for ranking purposes.I. Core Indicator Dimensions & Calculation Concepts:The algorithm evaluates companies based on the following key financial dimensions:A. Growth DimensionRevenue CAGR (Revenue_CAGR):Concept: Calculates the compound annual growth rate of historical annual revenue over the last N+1 available data points (where N is typically 3 or 5 years, defined in config). Uses the actual period covered by available data if less than N years of growth can be calculated.Purpose: Measures the historical average annual top-line growth rate.EPS CAGR (EPS_CAGR):Concept: Calculates the compound annual growth rate of historical annual diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the last N+1 available data points. Uses the actual period covered by available data. Returns NaN if starting EPS is non-positive.Purpose: Measures the historical average annual growth rate of profitability per share.Revenue Momentum (Slope_Revenue):Concept: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the most recent (up to 4) valid quarterly revenue growth rates (QoQ percentage change). Replaces infinite growth rates with NaN before regression.Purpose: Assesses the recent acceleration or deceleration trend in revenue growth.EPS Momentum (Slope_EPS):Concept: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the most recent (up to 4) valid quarterly EPS growth rates (QoQ percentage change). Handles zero/negative prior-quarter EPS based on config. Replaces infinite growth rates with NaN.Purpose: Assesses the recent acceleration or deceleration trend in profitability growth.B. Profitability & Efficiency DimensionTTM Operating Margin Level (TTM_OpMargin_Level):Concept: Calculated as Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) Operating Income divided by TTM Revenue. Requires 4 consecutive valid quarters of both op_income and revenue data for calculation.Purpose: Measures core business profitability over the past year.TTM Return on Equity Level (TTM_ROE_Level):Concept: Calculated as TTM Net Income divided by the average Shareholder Equity over the past 5 quarters. Requires 4 valid quarters of net_income and 5 valid quarters of equity data.Purpose: Measures the efficiency of using shareholder equity to generate profit over the past year.C. Cash Flow DimensionAnnual FCF Growth Slope (Annual_FCF_Growth_Slope):Concept: Calculates the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the last N+1 available years of annual Free Cash Flow (FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures).Purpose: Measures the growth trend in the company's ability to generate discretionary cash flow.D. Financial Health Dimension (Used for Screening Only)Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Latest Quarter):Concept: Calculated as Latest Quarter Total Debt divided by Latest Quarter Equity.Purpose: Measures financial leverage risk. Used to potentially filter out highly leveraged companies.Interest Coverage Ratio (TTM):Concept: Calculated as TTM Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) divided by TTM Interest Expense. Requires 4 valid quarters of both ebit and interest_exp. Special handling for zero/negative interest expense.Purpose: Measures the ability to cover interest payments. Used to potentially filter out companies with high debt servicing risk (current code ignores NaN ICR values during screening).II. Scoring & Ranking Process Outline:Calculate Indicators: Compute all raw indicators listed above for each company based on data retrieved from the database.Screening (Optional): Filter out companies failing financial health checks (Debt-to-Equity, Interest Coverage Ratio) based on configuration thresholds.Standardization: For companies passing the screen, convert the core performance indicators (CAGRs, Slopes, TTM Margin/ROE, FCF Slope) into percentile ranks (0-100) relative to peers ('overall' or by 'industry').Composite Score:Impute any missing standardized scores with 50 (median).Calculate fused growth scores (combining CAGR and Slope scores for Revenue and EPS using weights).Calculate the final Overall_Score by applying weights (from config) to the fused growth scores and the standardized scores for Profitability, Efficiency, and Cash Flow.Reset scores to NaN for companies that failed the initial screening.Ranking: Rank companies based on the final Overall_Score (descending).Note: The final score reflects a blend of historical growth (CAGR), recent momentum (Slopes), profitability/efficiency levels (TTM Margin/ROE), and cash flow trends (FCF Slope), adjusted for peer-relative performance through percentile ranking. Financial health metrics are used solely for initial screening.

To better understand each stock's trend score and fundamental score, you can refer to the overview of how these two scores are calculated.

My current portfolio includes the following holdings, displayed as "Ticker: (Cost Basis, Share Count, Latest price)": (NVDA:$135.90, 1119, $135.13), (ADP:$326.99, 457, $325.53), (APH:$84.30, 860, $89.93), (UBER:$77.66, 835, $84.16), (AVGO:$237.98, 638, $242.07), (BSX:$105.75, 1179, $105.26), (RL:$172.58, 181, $276.81), (HWM:$153.03, 737, $169.89), (Cash: $204,052).


Step 1 – Sentiment Analysis
For each stock listed above—including both the screened selections and the current portfolio holdings—conduct a comprehensive search and analysis of all news articles and social media discussions (e.g., on X, formerly Twitter) published between 2025-05-17 and 2025-05-31.
You can prioritize sentiment sources from official news outlets, X (formerly Twitter), earnings transcripts, and major financial news websites like Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, Wall street Journal and Seeking Alpha. You should focus on U.S.-based sentiment.
	•	Evaluate sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and coverage volume for every ticker, accounting for industry-specific factors such as sector trends, regulatory changes, and supply-chain dynamics.
	•	Integrate insights from the most recent earnings calls (up to 2025-05-31) to gauge management’s outlook on growth sustainability, revenue trajectories, and profitability, prioritizing stocks that exhibit consistent growth patterns and optimistic commentary suitable for a trend-based strategy.
	•	Assign each stock a sentiment score from 0 to 10 (10 = strongest positive sentiment and engagement; 0 = strongest negative).
	•	Provide a concise summary of sentiment trends for each stock, highlighting key events, recurring phrases, and the ways macroeconomic or industry factors shape perceptions.



Step 2 – Macroeconomic and Market Context

Analyze recent macroeconomic variables—including U.S. monetary policy (Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, forward guidance), inflation trends, GDP growth, tariffs, and other relevant economic policies—based on information published between 2025-05-17 and 2025-05-31. Prioritize official sources (e.g., Federal Reserve statements, Bureau of Economic Analysis reports, U.S. Treasury announcements) and major financial news websites (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ).

Examine contemporaneous trends in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices within the same time frame. Clearly synthesize these findings into a concise summary outlining the current macroeconomic environment, market sentiment, and outlook, specifically highlighting how recent U.S. monetary policy and macroeconomic shifts could impact equity market conditions in the near term.



Step 3 – Portfolio Adjustment and Rationale
Based on the latest fundamental, sentiment, and technical analyses of both my existing holdings and the screened stock selections—together with the current macroeconomic climate and market conditions as of 2025-05-31—recommend adjustments to optimize my portfolio.
Specifically:
* To help you make a more informed decision, I’ve listed the most recent market prices for each stock in my current portfolio. The format is: ‘Ticker: (Cost Basis, Share Count, Latest Price),’ where the last value indicates the latest available market price.
* Construct an optimized portfolio by selecting stocks exclusively from the combined set of my current holdings and the screened stocks.
* The optimized portfolio should hold no more than 7 stocks, including cash if justified.
* Ensure the total portfolio weights sum to exactly 100%.
* Given the anticipated holding period of 30 days, select positions expected to deliver favorable returns within this timeframe.
* When optimizing the portfolio, explicitly consider the current market prices, my original cost basis, and the predefined take-profit and stop-loss levels for each existing holding. Carefully evaluate whether the current market price is favorable before selling any stock. Similarly, thoroughly assess if the current market price presents a suitable buying opportunity when adding to existing positions or initiating new ones.


For each recommended stock or cash allocation, provide:
	1.	Rationale for selection. Clearly explain the reasoning behind choosing each stock or maintaining cash.
	2.	Determine the investment allocation and provide the rationale。
	3.	Define the exit strategy for the stock:
First, identify the stock’s latest price. Then, based on the current entry price, set a stop-loss level by specifying a percentage below the entry price and calculate the exact stop-loss price.
Also, set a take-profit level by specifying a percentage above the entry price and calculate the take-profit price.
The exit strategy should be informed by recent price levels, key technical support/resistance zones, or the stock’s volatility.
	4.	A concise justification summarizing strengths derived from:
	•	(a) Fundamental factors (e.g., earnings growth, valuation metrics).
	•	(b) Sentiment factors (e.g., investor perception, social-media buzz).
	•	(c) Technical factors (e.g., momentum, key support/resistance levels).
	5. Perform a technical analysis on this stock to determine whether the current price I’ve provided is a good buying opportunity. If it isn’t, suggest a price range that you believe would be more suitable for entry.


step 4 - Present your recommended stock and cash positions separately using both table and text formats:
- Table Format:
Clearly indicate the allocation percentage for each recommended stock. Additionally, include explicitly defined stop-loss and take-profit strategies, both expressed as percentages relative to the entry price. These strategies should be informed by recent price volatility, as well as key technical support and resistance levels.


- Text Format:
Provide a concise and clear presentation of each recommendation in a single line, using the following structure:
Ticker:Weight(e.g., AAPL:15%)
This format specifies the position size as a percentage of total capital, along with the number of shares currently held or to be transacted.


Requirements:

You must fully complete all the specified analysis steps. Ensure that your investment recommendations align accurately with market dynamics and conditions as of `2025-05-31`, aiming to enhance overall portfolio performance.


Finally, prepare your complete and structured analysis report in Chinese, ensuring it is logically organized, clearly articulated, and readily actionable for investment decision-making purposes.
